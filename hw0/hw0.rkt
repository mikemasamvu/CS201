; Homework #0 will be worth 20 points -- other homeworks will be worth
; 100 points (or so).  One purpose of homework #0 is to make sure you
; can use the submit system on the Zoo.  You will receive no credit
; for this assignment until you successfully use the submit system to
; submit it.

; You will be submitting *two* files for homework #0.  Please name
; them: hw0.rkt (for the Racket definitions and procedures)
; response.pdf (for the reading response)

; ********************************************************
; ** problem 0 ** (1 easy point) 

; Replace the number 0 in the definition below to indicate how many
; hours you spent doing this assignment.  Fractions are fine, eg,
; 3.14159.  You will receive no credit for this problem if you leave
; the number as 0.

(define hours 2)

; ********************************************************
; ** problem 1 ** (5 points)

; Write a procedure (kg2lb mass)

; which converts a mass in kilograms to the equivalent mass in pounds
; and ounces.  There are 2.2 pounds per kilogram.  There are 16 ounces
; in a pound.  All values are rounded down to the nearest integer.

; Examples

; (kg2lb .5) => '(1 pound 1 ounce)
; (kg2lb 1) => '(2 pounds 3 ounces)
; (kg2lb 2) => '(4 pounds 6 ounces)
; (kg2lb 3) => '(6 pounds 9 ounces)
; (kg2lb 4) => '(8 pounds 12 ounces)
; (kg2lb 9) => '(19 pounds 12 ounces)
; (kg2lb 10) => '(22 pounds 0 ounces)
; (kg2lb 100) => '(220 pounds 0 ounces)

; ********************************************************

; Replace "empty" in the code below with your procedure.  Make sure it
; is named kg2lb and has one argument.  The name of the argument is
; not important.

; Your procedure will be tested automatically with positive arguments.

(define (kg2lb mass)
  (define (pounds mass)(inexact->exact (floor(* mass 2.2))))
  (define (ounces mass)
     (inexact->exact(floor(* 16 (- (* mass 2.2)(inexact->exact (floor(* mass 2.2)))))))
   )

  (if (and (= (ounces mass) 1 (pounds mass) 1))
        (list (pounds mass) 'pound (ounces mass) 'ounce)
        (list (pounds mass) 'pounds (ounces mass) 'ounces)
  )
)

    
; ********************************************************
; ** problem 2 ** (4 points)

; Write a procedure (timezone) that takes no arguments and returns a
; *string* indicating your time zone.

; Please remember the difference between a procedure call and the
; evaluation of a variable!

; Example (yours might be different)

; (timezone) => "EST"

; ********************************************************

; Replace "empty" in the code below with your procedure.  Make sure it
; is named timezone and takes no arguments.  Your procedure will be
; tested automatically, and will be called only with no arguments.

(define (timezone)
  "EST")

; ********************************************************
; ** problem 3 ** (10 points)

; For this problem, you are asked to find one article (of 2 pages or
; more) in the magazine "Communications of the ACM", in one of the
; issues: November, December 2022, January, February 2023
; See http://cacm.acm.org/

; read the article and answer the following three questions:

;   a. What did you know about the topic
;      prior to reading the article?
;   b. What did you learn from reading the
;      article?
;   c. What more would you like to know
;      about the topic?

; Your answer should be AT MOST 2 pages saved in pdf format, and
; submitted as the file response.pdf for assignment 0.  Please include
; in your file your name and email address and the title and author(s)
; of the article you are responding to.

; Your grade for this problem will be 10 if we can open, print and read
; your submitted pdf file.  It is to help us get acquainted with you
; and your interests -- you won't receive feedback on your answers.
